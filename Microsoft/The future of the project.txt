There are a few thing needed to finish the project that I could not do while adhering to the deadline:
1. Check the conectivity of the server on Azure.
2. Install on server an agent for Azure Devops.
3. Apply for parallelism request on Azure Devops.
4. Run the python blob script on the server.

The rest of the things I managed to complete, hopefuly in a satisfactory manner. If you have any critisism, I would love to hear it at the earliest convenience.
Have a wonderful day.
